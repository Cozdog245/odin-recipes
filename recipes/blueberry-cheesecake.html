        <h2>Blueberry Cheesecake</h2>

        <p>
            To say this Blueberry Cheesecake is bursting with blueberries is an understatement! Baked to achieve that elusive light-yet-rich creamy cheesecake filling, studded with blueberries inside and smothered in an incredible glossy blueberry sauce topping. Itâ€™s magnificent!
        </p>

        <p>Don't be daunted by the number of steps - they are straightforward, I've just broken it down into managable steps. Cheesecakes are actually less "risky" than cakes because - no worries about not rising, sinking in middle etc.</p>

        <p>If blueberries are expensive right now but you're absolutely busting to make this, skip the topping and serve with cream instead.</p>
